# Brain_tumor_dataset

ðŸ“Œ Dataset Description
The Brain Tumor Dataset contains medical, clinical, and diagnostic information of 20,000 patients.
It is designed to help in brain tumor analysis, classification, treatment prediction, and survival analysis.

ðŸ”¹ Features:
Patient Demographics â€“ Patient ID, Age, Gender
Tumor Details â€“ Tumor Type (Benign/Malignant), Tumor Size, Location, Histology, Stage
Symptoms â€“ Symptom_1, Symptom_2, Symptom_3
Treatment Information â€“ Radiation Treatment, Surgery Performed, Chemotherapy
Medical Outcomes â€“ Survival Rate, Tumor Growth Rate, MRI Results, Follow-up Requirement
Family History â€“ Genetic influence (Yes/No)

ðŸ”¹ Use Cases:
Brain tumor detection & classification
Survival prediction of patients
Treatment recommendation systems
Medical research & analysis for tumor progression
None
